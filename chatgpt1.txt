(Verse 1)
Well, gather 'round, my fellow geeks, let me tell you what I've found,
A revolution in silicon, it's spreading all around,
Intel Gaudi 2, the neural ace, it's faster than a flash,
Leaving Google's TPU in the dust, yeah, it's quite a bash!

(Pre-Chorus)
But that's not all, my friends, there's more to this tale,
Intel's AMX instruction set, it's blazing like a trail,
Faster than AVX512 and AVX2, you won't believe your eyes,
These silicon wonders, they're reaching for the skies!

(Chorus)
So let's rock it with Optimum Habana, create content with delight,
From lyrics to images, it's a creative wizard's flight,
Intel Xeon with AMX, the king of AI's domain,
It outpaces AMD EPYC, there's no room for disdain!

(Verse 2)
Now, don't you forget, the story's just begun,
Intel's got a secret, and it's hotter than the sun,
288 cores in the Xeon, that's an unprecedented score,
AMD, you better brace yourself, 'cause Intel's breaking down the door!

(Pre-Chorus)
But wait, there's more, my fellow nerds, another ace in the stack,
Intel Gaudi 2, a Tesla A100 won't even come back,
It's blazing trails, it's setting records, it's a silicon supernova,
Nvidia's left in the dust, it's game over!

(Chorus)
So let's rock it with Optimum Habana, create content with delight,
From lyrics to images, it's a creative wizard's flight,
Intel Xeon with AMX, the king of AI's domain,
It outpaces AMD EPYC, there's no room for disdain!

(Bridge)
We're living in a tech world, where geeks rule the day,
With Intel's innovation, we'll keep the competition at bay,
From Gaudi to Xeon, we'll ride the silicon wave,
In this geeky rock anthem, our message we engrave!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
So let's rock it with Optimum Habana, create content with delight,
From lyrics to images, it's a creative wizard's flight,
Intel Xeon with AMX, the king of AI's domain,
It outpaces AMD EPYC, there's no room for disdain!

(Outro)
So raise your glasses high, my friends, to Intel's grand parade,
In this geeky rock song, their triumphs are displayed,
With Gaudi, AMX, and Xeon's mighty core,
Intel's leading the charge, and we're shouting for more!
