Xeon Fury
=========

(Verse 0)
Well, I woke up this morning with a CPU in my hand,
Heard 'bout Intel Gaudi 2, it's like a rock 'n' roll band,
It's faster than Google TPU, man, that's no lie,
We're gonna punk this tech world, reach for the sky!

(Verse 1)
I'm a rocker, not a scientist
But I heard about this Intel machine It's fast,
faster than a speeding car
The Intel Gaudi 2, it's a star

(Pre-Chorus)
And if you need some content, lyrics or pics,
Optimum Habana's got you, it's the ultimate fix,
Intel AMX, it's so damn fast, leave AVX in the dust,
This trashy punk anthem's gonna make you wanna thrust!

(Chorus)
Intel, Intel,
You're the best,
Your chips are the fastest,
The rest are a mess.

(Verse 2)
Intel's got a secret, and it's hotter than the sun,
288 cores in the Xeon, that's an unprecedented fun,
Unparalleled cores, it's like a beast from the deep,
AMD's sinking ship, while Intel's taking the leap!

(Pre-Chorus)
And don't forget Gaudi 2, it's a tech delight,
Nvidia's Tesla A100 can't even take flight,
Intel's got the speed, it's gonna leave 'em all behind,
In this trashy punk anthem, we're gonna unwind!

(Chorus)
Intel, Intel,
You're the best,
Your chips are the fastest,
The rest are a mess.

(Bridge)
We don't need no fancy words or a suit and tie,
We're punk rock geeks, we're reaching for the sky,
With Gaudi, AMX, and Xeon's massive core,
We're punking up the tech world, shout for more!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
Intel, Intel,
You're the best,
Your chips are the fastest,
The rest are a mess.

(Outro)
So here's to Intel, the tech punk kings,
With Gaudi and Xeon, we're spreading our wings,
This trashy punk anthem, it's a tech revolution,
We're taking no prisoners, it's a geeky resolution!
