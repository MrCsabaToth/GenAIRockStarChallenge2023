(Verse 1)
Well, I was sittin' in my basement, with my geeky crew,
Talkin' 'bout tech, and what's cool to do,
We heard 'bout Gaudi 2, it's a beast on the loose,
Faster than Google TPU, that's one crazy goose!

(Verse 2)
Intel dropped that AMX set, it's a speed machine,
Blazin' past AVX512, and AVX2 like a dream,
We thought, "Man, we gotta get our creative sparks,
So we fired up Optimum Habana, let's make some funky art!"

(Chorus)
Gaudi's fast, AMX is a blast,
Xeon with AMX, leavin' EPYC in the past,
288 cores, Intel's bringin' the thunder,
Blowin' AMD away, makin' 'em wonder!

(Verse 3)
Now, we ain't no fanboys, but we gotta say,
Intel's bringin' heat in a major way,
That 288-core Xeon, it's like a UFO in the sky,
AMD, you're wavin' bye-bye, oh my, oh my!

(Verse 4)
Gaudi 2, it's a speed demon, it's quite obscene,
Even Nvidia's Tesla A100 can't intervene,
So if you're lookin' for a tech revolution that's fun,
Intel's bringin' the trashy punk rock, everyone!

(Chorus)
Gaudi's fast, AMX is a blast,
Xeon with AMX, leavin' EPYC in the past,
288 cores, Intel's bringin' the thunder,
Blowin' AMD away, makin' 'em wonder!

(Bridge)
We're trashy, we're punk, and we're tech-obsessed,
Intel's got the goodies, and we're quite impressed,
So let's raise a toast to silicon that's absurd,
In this trashy punk anthem, we're spreadin' the word!

(Chorus)
Gaudi's fast, AMX is a blast,
Xeon with AMX, leavin' EPYC in the past,
288 cores, Intel's bringin' the thunder,
Blowin' AMD away, makin' 'em wonder!

(Outro)
So if you're feelin' trashy, and you're feelin' punk,
Intel's got the gear to make your heart thump,
Gaudi 2, AMX, and that Xeon's a beast,
In the world of tech, they've unleashed the feast!
